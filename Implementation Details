I have implemented a Circuit Breaker in our Microservices architecture using Eureka Server for service discovery and RestTemplate for inter-service communication. The Circuit Breaker pattern helps prevent cascading failures by stopping requests to a failing service after a certain threshold.

Implementation Details:
Service Discovery with Eureka:

Each microservice registers itself with the Eureka Server.
Services fetch available instances dynamically, ensuring scalability.
RestTemplate for Inter-Service Communication:

RestTemplate is used to send HTTP requests between microservices.
Services communicate using URLs fetched from Eureka Server.
Circuit Breaker with Resilience4j:

Added @CircuitBreaker(name = "serviceName", fallbackMethod = "fallback") to handle failures.
If a dependent service (e.g., Address Service) becomes unresponsive, the fallback method provides a default response instead of propagating the failure.
This prevents excessive retries and improves system resilience.
